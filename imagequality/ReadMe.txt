Image / Picture Quality Measures

In this application, different image quality measures are calculated for a distorted image with reference to an original image. To test the application, a set of 20 distorted images is included in this package. The list of Image Quality measures implemented in this package include,

1. Structural Content (SC)
2. Mean Square Error (MSE)
3. Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR in dB)
4. Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC)
5. Average Difference (AD)
6. Maximum Difference (MD)
7. Normalized Absolute Error (NAE)

Refer "Reference.png" for the mathematical expressions implemented in this package.

Original images are kept in the folder "OriginalImages".
Distorted images are kept in the folder "DistortedImages".
